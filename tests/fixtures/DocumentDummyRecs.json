Classic papers in the field of psychiatric ethics and their references were manually searched. Papers were selected for relevance to the topic of the dual-role dilemma in relation to psychiatry.|Results: The dual-role dilemma is most explicitly addressed in the literature on forensic psychiatry and military psychiatry. Review of the ethics literature in other fields of psychiatry indicates many instances of the dilemma of psychiatrists facing conflicting obligations akin to the dual-role problem identified in the literature on forensic psychiatry. Many of these dilemmas are characterized by the presence of a powerful third party to whom the psychiatrist has some perceived obligations.|Conclusions: In psychiatric ethics, the dual-role dilemma refers to the tension between psychiatrists' obligations of beneficence towards their patients, and conflicting obligations to the community, third parties, other health-care workers, or the pursuit of knowledge in the field. These conflicting obligations transcend a conflict of interest in that the expectations of the psychiatrist, other than the patient's best interests, are so compelling. This tension illustrates how the discourse in psychiatric ethics is embedded in the social and cultural context of the situations encountered. It appears that as society changes in its approach to the value of liberal autonomy and the 'collective good', psychiatrists may also need to change.","citationKey":"1086","doi":"10.1080\/00048670701827291","authorAddress":"Robertson, MD (reprint author), Univ Sydney, Discipline Psychol Med, Cent Clin Sch, Sydney, NSW 2006, AustraliaUniv Sydney, Discipline Psychol Med, Cent Clin Sch, Sydney, NSW 2006, AustraliaRoyal Prince Alfred Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Camperdown, NSW 2050, AustraliaUniv Sydney, Discipline Psychol Med, No Clin Sch, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","authorList":["Robertson, MD","Walter, G"],"keywords":["CONFLICT","PSYCHIATRY","psychotherapy","ISSUES","MENTAL-HEALTH-CARE","ethics","forensic psychiatry","ADOLESCENT-PSYCHIATRY","BIOETHICS","CONSULTATION-LIAISON PSYCHIATRY","dual-role dilemma","MANAGED CARE","TARASOFF"],"id":"doi:10.1080\/00048670701827291"},

Although scholarly attention has often focused on demographic factors, (e.g., gender and race), sufficiently prevalent acquired characteristic,, may also help explain widespread individual differences on standardized tests. In particular, this article focuses on the role that posttraumatic stress symptoms (PSS) potentially play in standardized academic assessments. Using a military sample measured before and after exposure to war-zone stressors, the authors sought to explain test-taking ability differences with respect to symptoms of PTSD on two cognitive tasks that closely match standardized test constructs. The primary method for this analysis is based on an item response theory with covariates approach. Findings suggest that the effect for PSS is significant on both tasks, particularly for those who experience the highest levels of PSS following war-zone exposure. Findings provide potentially valuable information regarding the nature of the relationship between PSS and verbal and logical reasoning test performance.","url":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0022066310600177","citationKey":"1097","doi":"10.1037\/a0017287","authorAddress":"Rutkowski, L (reprint author), Int Assoc Evaluat Educ Achievement, Data Proc & Res Ctr, Mexikoring 37, D-22297 Hamburg, GermanyUniv Illinois, Dept Educ Psychol, Urbana, IL 61801 USAVA Boston Healthcare Syst, Boston, MA USABoston Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USAUSA, Inst Environm Med, Natick, MA 01760 USA","authorList":["Rutkowski, L","Vasterling, JJ","Proctor, SP","Anderson, CJ"],"keywords":["MENTAL-HEALTH PROBLEMS","SYMPTOMS","VIETNAM VETERANS","SOLDIERS","posttraumatic stress disorder","PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES","MODELS","memory","PTSD CHECKLIST","INTELLECTUAL RESOURCES","standardized testing","test taking","VIOLENCE EXPOSURE"],"id":"doi:10.1037\/a0017287"},

We conducted an anonymous cross-sectional survey to assess the prevalence and impact of common ailments among U.S. military personnel deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan during 2003-2004. Among 15,459 persons surveyed, diarrhea (76.8% in Iraq and 54.4% in Afghanistan), respiratory illness (69.1%), non-combat injuries (34.7%), and leishmaniasis (2.1%) were commonly reported. For all causes, 25.2% reported that they required intravenous fluids, 1.0.4% required hospitalization, and 5.2% required medical evacuation. Among ground units, 12.7% reported that they missed a patrol because of illness, and among air units, 11.7% were grounded because of illness. The incidence of diarrhea and respiratory infections doubled from the pre-combat to combat phases, and the perceived adverse impact of these illnesses on the unit increased significantly during the combat phase. Despite technologic advances in warfare and preventive medicine, illness and non-combat injuries have been common during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, resulting in frequent transient decreases in operational efficiency.","citationKey":"1106","authorAddress":"Sanders, JW (reprint author), USN, Med Res Unit 3, Enter Dis Res Program, PSC 452,Box 117,FPO AE 09835, Cairo, EgyptUSN, Med Res Unit 3, Enter Dis Res Program, Cairo, EgyptUSN, Med Res Unit 2, Jakarta, IndonesiaUSN, Med Res Ctr, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA","authorList":["Sanders, JW","Putnam, SD","Frankart, C","Frenck, RW","Monteville, MR","Riddle, MS","Rockabrand, DM","Sharp, TW","Tribble, DR"],"keywords":["CARE","MILITARY","MENTAL-HEALTH","WAR VETERANS","safety","BATTLE","DEET","DESERT-SHIELD","DISEASE RATES","OUTPATIENT VISITS"],"meshTerms":["Afghanistan","Athletic Injuries","Back Injuries","Data Collection","Diarrhea","Health Surveys","Humans","Incidence","Iraq","Leishmaniasis","Military Personnel","Respiratory Tract Diseases","Software","War"],"id":"http:\/\/msrc.idiginfo.org\/documents\/8813\/pub"},

This population health program includes a modified version of the Two-Item Conjoint Screen (TICS), which is widely used in primary care to screen for alcohol misuse. Rates of referral in the military for alcohol treatment are very low, and the utility of these screening questions in predicting serious alcohol-related behaviors is unknown. Methods: Anonymous surveys were collected from 6,527 U. S. Army soldiers who were screened three to four months after returning from deployment to Iraq. Positive responses on the TICS alcohol screen were correlated with alcohol-related behaviors. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using logistic regression, after adjusting for gender, rank, race, and military component (active or reserve). Results: Twenty-seven percent of soldiers screened positive for alcohol misuse. Compared with soldiers who screened negative, those who screened positive were more likely to have recently engaged in the following behaviors: drinking and driving (OR=4.99, 95% confidence interval [CI]=4.31-5.76), riding with a driver who had been drinking (OR=5.87, CI=4.99-6.91), reporting late or missing work because of a hangover (OR=9.24, CI=6.73-12.68), using illicit drugs (OR=4.97, CI=3.68-6.71), being referred to alcohol rehabilitation (OR=7.15, CI=4.84-10.58), and being convicted of driving under the influence (OR=4.84, CI=3.04-7.67). Conclusions: Positive responses to a two-item alcohol screening tool were strongly associated with serious alcohol-related behaviors. This study highlights the need to improve screening and access to care for alcohol-related problems among service members returning from combat deployments.

This study examined correlates of self-perceived need for mental health care among active military personnel. Methods: Data were from a 2002 cross-sectional population-based survey of 8,441 active Canadian military personnel (2,592 women) aged 16 to 54 (response rate 81%). A fully structured lay-administered interview for past-year DSM-IV mental disorders and perceived need for mental health care was conducted. Five domains of self-perceived need were assessed: information, medication, counseling, social intervention, and skills training. Several deployment factors were assessed (length of deployment, number of deployments, and exposure to deployment-related traumatic events), as were long-term restriction in activities because of disability and suicidal ideation. Multiple logistic regression models were used to determine correlates of perceived need. Results: After adjustment for mental disorders, the strongest and most consistent correlates of perceived need were long-term restriction in activities, suicidal ideation, female gender, and regular service status (versus reserve status) (adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.28 to 4.37). Deployment and exposure to combat and witnessing atrocities were moderately associated with an increase in self-perceived need for mental health care. Conclusions: The findings suggest that a range of issues beyond the presence of common mental disorders need to be considered in understanding the factors that contribute to a sense of need for mental health treatment. Post-deployment screening programs should consider systematically assessing self-perceived need for mental health treatment.

An understanding of factors affecting treatment initiation for PTSD can inform strategies to promote help-seeking. We conducted a qualitative study to identify determinants of PTSD treatment initiation among 44 U.S. military veterans from the Vietnam and Afghanistan\/Iraq wars; half were and half were not receiving treatment. Participants described barriers to and facilitators of treatment initiation within themselves, the post-trauma socio-cultural environment, the health care and disability systems, and their social networks. Lack of knowledge about PTSD was a barrier that occurred at both the societal and individual levels. Another important barrier theme was the enduring effect of experiencing an invalidating socio-cultural environment following trauma exposure. In some cases, system and social network facilitation led to treatment initiation despite individual-level barriers, such as beliefs and values that conflicted with help-seeking. Our findings expand the dominant model of service utilization by explicit incorporation of factors outside the individual into a conceptual framework of PTSD treatment initiation. Finally, we offer suggestions regarding the direction of future research and the development of interventions to promote timely help-seeking for PTSD.","url":"http:\/\/guilfordjournals.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1521\/psyc.2009.72.3.238","citationKey":"1113","doi":"10.1521\/psyc.2009.72.3.238","authorAddress":"Sayer, NA (reprint author), Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Ctr Chron Dis Outcomes Res, Minneapolis, MN 55417 USAVet Affairs Med Ctr, Ctr Chron Dis Outcomes Res, Minneapolis, MN 55417 USAUniv Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USAVA Med Ctr, Mental & Behav Hlth Sect, Minneapolis, MN USAConnecticut VA Healthcare Syst, NEPEC, West Haven, CT USA","authorList":["Sayer, Nina A.","Friedemann-Sanchez, G","Spoont, M","Murdoch, M.","Parker, LE","Chiros, C","Rosenheck, R"],"keywords":["posttraumatic stress disorder","NATIONAL COMORBIDITY SURVEY","mental health services","TREATMENT SEEKING","COMBAT VETERANS","SURVEY REPLICATION","VIETNAM THEATER VETERANS","CAUSAL MODEL","BEHAVIORAL-MODEL","PTSD","treatment"],"meshTerms":["Adult","Afghan Campaign 2001-","Attitude","Humans","Iraq War, 2003 -","Middle Aged","Models, Psychological","Patient Acceptance of Health Care","Qualitative Research","Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","Veterans","Vietnam Conflict","Needs Assessment","Patient Education as Topic","Population Surveillance","Prevalence","Questionnaires","Relief Work","Suicide, Attempted","Young Adult"],"id":"doi:10.1521\/psyc.2009.72.3.238"},

Couples in which one spouse has recently returned from military deployment in Iraq or Afghanistan and are experiencing marital problems can present a significant treatment challenge. There is little empirical evidence regarding effective treatments for this population, and these couples tend to exhibit a wide range of difficulties, including the following: conflicts about reintegration, problems with posttraumatic stress disorder and\/or depression, chronic injury, infidelity, and personal and social challenges associated with rejoining civilian life. Behavioral couples therapy provides a useful framework for intervention with these couples, combined with individual treatment and education about the impact of combat deployment. This paper discusses considerations for integrating these treatment approaches and future clinical and research needs for these couples.\r\n\r\nOne of the enduring effects of the controversial war in Vietnam has been an ever-increasing focus on the problems of military service members returning from a wartime deployment. The literature pertaining to this issue has expanded after every major military conflict or involvement since that time, including the first Gulf War, peace-keeping missions in Bosnia, and, most recently, the conflicts in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom [OEF]) and Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom [OIF]). In the wake of the OEF and OIF conflicts, we have another such painful opportunity to examine the impact of wartime deployment, problems in family reintegration after deployment, and our therapeutic methods of helping these families.\r\n\r\nExisting literature suggests that there is a negative impact of war on couples and family functioning (Kulka et al., 1988). As discussed below, that impact does not appear to be as universal and devastating as popularly believed. Over the long term, many families successfully navigate the challenge of the service member returning and becoming part of the family again, a process termed family reintegration. It is clear, however, that extended difficulty with family reintegration after wartime deployment is most acute when there are preexisting couple and family vulnerabilities as well as service member injury and psychiatric complications of combat (Peebles-Kleiger & Kleiger, 1994). In this context, there is a range of co-occurring difficulties often challenging the military couple: financial problems, problems with negotiating family roles, child behavioral challenges, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, physical injury and rehabilitation, difficulty making the transition to new career roles, and relocation. In addition, couples may be facing severe marital discord and the impact of infidelity that occurred during the deployment (Peebles-Kleiger & Kleiger). Existing treatments do not fully address how to help service members and their families with this level of complexity.\r\n\r\nThis article will focus on treating couples with a service member recently returned from OEF or OIF conflicts, with particular attention toward dealing with problems with reintegration. Broader interventions focusing on child difficulties of military veterans are outside the scope of the current paper; indeed, child difficulties and treatments are sufficiently broad topics that they deserve special focus (see Campbell, Brown, & Okwara, 2010; 2011). I discuss below the difficulties faced by these couples, an organizing framework for understanding their problems, and considerations for applying couples-based interventions to these complex clinical situations. I also present several case illustrations of work conducted with OEF-OIF veterans and their spouses, with a discussion of applying these considerations to treatment.","url":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1077722910001227","citationKey":"1114","doi":"doi:10.1016\/j.cbpra.2010.03.002","authorAddress":"Sayers, SL (reprint author), Philadelphia Vet Affairs Med Ctr, MIRECC 116,3900 Woodland Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USAPhiladelphia Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USAUniv Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","authorList":["Sayers, SL"],"keywords":["POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER","DEPLOYMENT","MENTAL-HEALTH PROBLEMS","MALE VIETNAM VETERANS","DOMESTIC VIOLENCE","INTERVENTIONS","US ARMY SOLDIERS","COGNITIVE-PROCESSING THERAPY","IRAQI FREEDOM VETERANS","MARITAL-THERAPY"],"id":"doi:doi:10.1016\/j.cbpra.2010.03.002"},

In a cross-sectional study of mental health in army conscripts using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), the case prevalence was 48 % (cut-off 2\/3). This was remarkably high, given that the study population had been screened for mental disease on several occasions, and a large number of recruits with symptoms of mental disease had been excluded before the survey began. Statistical analyses indicated that the high case prevalence was mainly due to situational factors. Four dimensions were identified: (1) social relations with officers, peers and family, (2) structural factors inherent in the system of obligatory military service, (3) the meaningfulness of daily tasks and (4) financial problems. GHQ caseness was statistically associated with physical inactivity and consumption of junk-food, tobacco, alcohol and cannabis.

Group psychotherapy's first growth spurt occurred during World War II, when understaffed military hospitals in both the United States and England were forced to use group treatment measures to attend to the large number of psychiatric casualties. In the 1960s the community mental health centers movement, with its mandate to serve many people in large catchment areas, became another impetus for the employment of group approaches in both remedial and preventive contexts.

In this article we seek to draw greater attention to the effects of deployment on service members and to provide an overview of recent literature on the impact of deployment on service members and military families. A further goal is then to provide one conceptual perspective-a model of family stability that may help inform our understanding of the impact of military deployment on families. Beyond informing research, the issues presented in this article have far-reaching consequences not only for American military families and their current mental health and primary care providers but also for practitioners in the broader mental health community who will be increasingly called upon to provide services to this population.","url":"http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/journals\/amp\/65\/6\/599\/","citationKey":"1126","doi":"10.1037\/a0020332","authorAddress":"Sheppard, SC (reprint author), SUNY Albany, Dept Psychol, SS 369,1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USASUNY Albany, Dept Psychol, Albany, NY 12222 USA","authorList":["Sheppard, SC","Malatras, JW","Israel, AC"],"keywords":["POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER","AFGHANISTAN","VETERANS","MENTAL-HEALTH PROBLEMS","combat","ADJUSTMENT","DESERT-STORM","father absence","military deployment","OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM","CHILD MALTREATMENT","child outcomes","family outcomes","family stability"],"id":"doi:10.1037\/a0020332"},

Among veterans using VA services, women were younger, better educated, and less likely to be married than male veterans. Women veterans who use VA ambulatory services scared lower on every scale except physical functioning and general health perceptions when compared to male VA users. There were more pronounced differences for women on scales measuring emotional health.|Conclusions: Health status among women veterans is moderate to poor.

This study examined the role of hardiness in the psychological well-being of military officer candidates undergoing basic training. Although most researchers have conceptualized hardiness as a global psychological construct, it is possible that military-specific hardiness, which pertains specifically to work experiences in the military environment, may be a more relevant measure. The role of both general and military-specific hardiness in life satisfaction, health symptoms, training satisfaction, and training stress was examined. The results of this study were consistent with those of previous research, suggesting that military-specific hardiness is an important predictor of psychological well-being of military personnel. Furthermore, military-specific hardiness served as a better predictor of the psychological well-being of military personnel than general hardiness.

Concerns about vaccine-related adverse health effects followed, prompting several studies. Although some studies used self-reported vaccination data, the reliability of such data has not been established. The purpose of this study was to compare self-reported anthrax vaccination to electronic vaccine records among a large military cohort and to evaluate the relationship between vaccine history and health outcome data.|Methods: Between September 2005 and February 2006 self-reported anthrax vaccination was compared to electronic records for 67,018 participants enrolled in the Millennium Cohort Study between 2001 and 2003 using kappa statistics. Multivariable modeling investigated vaccination concordance as it pertains to subjective health (functional status) and objective health (hospitalization) metrics.|Results: Greater than substantial agreement (kappa=0.80) was found between self-report and electronic recording of anthrax vaccination. Of all participants with electronic documentation of anthrax vaccination, 98% self-reported being vaccinated; and of all participants with no electronic record of vaccination, 90% self-reported not receiving a vaccination. There were no differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants in overall measures of health. Only the subset of participants who self-reported anthrax vaccination, but had no electronic confirmation, differed from others in the cohort, with consistently lower measures of health as indicated by Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey for Veterans (SF-36V) scores.|Conclusions: These results indicate that military members accurately recall their anthrax vaccinations. Results also suggest that anthrax vaccination among Millennium Cohort participants is not associated with self-reported health problems or broad measures of health problems severe enough to require hospitalization. Service members who self-report vaccination with no electronic documentation of vaccination, however, report lower measures of physical and mental health and deserve further research.","citationKey":"1131","authorAddress":"Smith, B (reprint author), USN, Hlth Res Ctr, DOD, Ctr Deployment Hlth Res, POB 85122, San Diego, CA 92186 USAUSN, Hlth Res Ctr, DOD, Ctr Deployment Hlth Res, San Diego, CA 92186 USA","authorList":["Smith, B","Leard, CA","Smith, TC","Reed, RJ","Ryan, MAK"],"keywords":["MILITARY SERVICE","SELF-REPORT","PERSIAN-GULF-WAR","ERA VETERANS","ARMED-FORCES","SURVEILLANCE","ELDERLY OUTPATIENTS","IMMUNIZATION","INFLUENZA","PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINATION"],"id":"http:\/\/msrc.idiginfo.org\/documents\/8838\/pub"},

Effective military operations require optimal health of deployed service members, and both mental and physical health can be affected by military operations.|Methods: Baseline data were collected from 77,047 US service members during 2001-2003 as part of a large, longitudinal, population-based military health study (the Millennium Cohort Study). The authors calculated unadjusted, adjusted, and weighted means for the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-item Survey for Veterans physical (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores over a variety of demographic and military characteristics at baseline.|Results: The unadjusted mean PCS and MCS scores for this study were 53.4 (95% confidence interval: 53.3-53.4) and 52.8 (95% confidence interval: 52.7-52.9). Average PCS and MCS scores were slightly more favorable in this military sample compared to those of the US general population of the same age and sex. Factors independently associated with more favorable health status included male gender, being married, higher educational attainment, higher military rank, and Air Force service. Combat specialists had similar health status compared to other military occupations. Having been deployed to Southwest Asia, Bosnia, or Kosovo between 1998 and 2000 was not associated with diminished health status.|Conclusion: The baseline health status of this large population-based military cohort is better than that of the US general population of the same age and sex distribution over the same time period, especially in older age groups. Deployment experiences during the period of 1998-2001 were not associated with decreased health status.

The data for this study come from the 2001 Veteran Identity Program Survey, which measured utilization of outpatient care, discrimination, and health status across three minority veteran groups. Multivariate regression methods were used to model self-reported mental and physical health on perceptions of discrimination controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Findings revealed that racial\/ethnic discrimination during military service was significantly associated with lower physical, but not mental health.

Method: The study population consisted of 2347 Finnish boys born during 1981 attending military call-up (79.7% of the original sample). At age 8, the boys were evaluated by parental and teacher Rutter scales and by self-reports using the Child Depression Inventory (CDI). At military call-up 10 years later, the boys filled in the Young Adult Self-Report (YASR). Information about psychiatric disorders recognized at the military call-up health examination was obtained from the national military register. Results: About 4.6% of boys were recognized as having a psychiatric disorder at the military call-up medical examination. In addition, 23.1% of boys reported emotional, behavioral or relational difficulties but were not recognized as having an ICD 10 psychiatric diagnosis at the military call-up medical examination. A higher level of psychopathology, problems across different life domains and early onset of problems were more strongly associated with recognition of psychiatric disorder than with self-reports of difficulties without a recognized psychiatric disorder. All informant sources, parents, teachers and children themselves at age 8, independently predicted recognition of psychiatric disorders and perceived difficulties 10 years later. Conclusions: Only a minority of adolescents with psychiatric problems are recognized as having a psychiatric disorder in the health services. Efforts to prevent psychiatric disturbance in early life are emphasized. The use of screening methods in school health settings to detect children in need of child mental health services is justified.","url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1469-7610.2005.00412.x\/abstract","citationKey":"1145","doi":"10.1111\/j.1469-7610.2005.00412.x","authorAddress":"Sourander, A (reprint author), Turku Univ Hosp, Dept Child Psychiat, Turku 20520, FinlandTurku Univ Hosp, Dept Child Psychiat, Turku 20520, Finland","authorList":["Sourander, A","Haavisto, A","Ronning, JA","Multimaki, P","Parkkola, K","Santalahti, P","Nikolakaros, G","Helenius, H","Moilanen, I","Tamminen, T","Piha, J","Kumpulainen, K","Almqvist, F"],"keywords":["PREVALENCE","MENTAL-HEALTH","children","FOLLOW-UP","PSYCHOPATHOLOGY","epidemiology","CHILDHOOD","ADOLESCENTS","HEALTH-SERVICE USE","BEHAVIORAL-PROBLEMS","child psychiatry","YOUNG ADULTHOOD","EPIDEMIOLOGIC SAMPLE"],"meshTerms":["Adolescent","Child","Cross-Sectional Studies","Family","Finland","Follow-Up Studies","Humans","Logistic Models","Mass Screening","Mental Disorders","Military Personnel","Multivariate Analysis","Risk Factors","Risk-Taking","Self Concept","Veterans","War","Time Factors","United States","United States Department of Veterans Affairs","War","Referral and Consultation","Role","Spouse Abuse","Veterans","Young Adult"],"id":"doi:10.1111\/j.1469-7610.2005.00412.x"},

Method: The sample included long-term outcome data on 2,556 Finnish boys born in 1981. The aim was to study the impact of early childhood psychopathology types (externalizing versus internalizing versus both) and informant sources (self-report versus parent\/teacher reports) on young adult outcomes, based on data from a military registry of psychiatric diagnosis, a police registry on criminal and drug offenses, and self-reported problems in late adolescence and early adulthood. Results: Children with combined conduct and internalizing problems at age 8 had the worst outcomes and highest risk of subsequent psychiatric disorders, criminal offenses, and self-reported problems at follow-up, with 62% of these boys manifesting psychiatric disorders, committing criminal offenses, or both at follow-up. Although these children included only 4% of the sample, they were responsible for 26% of all criminal offenses at follow-up. In contrast, children with conduct problems without internalizing problems and those with attention problems had much less severe but nonetheless elevated levels of risk of antisocial personality disorder and criminal offenses. Long-term outcomes for these two groups were substantially better than for children with combined conduct and internalizing problems. Children with \"pure\" emotional problems had an elevated risk only of similar emotional problems at follow-up. Conclusions: The subjective suffering and long-term burden to society is especially high among children with comorbid conduct and internalizing problems in childhood. A major challenge for child and adolescent psychiatric, education, and social services is to develop effective intervention strategies focusing on these children.

I propose that anticipatory\r\nguidance of adolescents should also include discussion\r\nabout military service and alternatives, the laws regarding\r\nregistration (and consequences for failure to register)\r\nwith the Selective Service System (SSS), and the medical\r\nand psychological effects of war. Specific developmental\r\nchallenges face adolescents who opt for (United States)\r\nor are required to participate in (many other countries)\r\nmilitary service. By late adolescence, individuals have\r\nusually developed the ability to think in abstract terms,\r\nplan for their future, and engage in independent life\r\nchoices,5 yet this age group still lacks full psychosocial\r\nmaturation. Exposure to the demands of military service\r\n(absolute conformity and obedience, lack of independence,\r\nseparation from family, real risk of physical\r\nharm) places unique stresses on adolescents in peacetime\r\nand even more so during times of war.5\r\nThe purpose of this commentary is to raise awareness\r\namong pediatricians and other providers of adolescent\r\nhealth care about current SSS laws, possible changes to\r\nsuch laws that could occur at any time, and options\r\navailable to adolescents who, by reason of conscience,\r\nchoose not to participate in military service or perhaps\r\neven register with the SSS.

Controlling for demographic and deployment characteristics, spouses who experienced extensions fared worse on an array of measures, including mental well-being (e.g., feelings of depression), household strains (e.g., problems with household and car maintenance), and some areas of their jobs (having to stop work or to work fewer hours). There were no statistically significant differences regarding problems pertaining to their overall health, marriage, other work issues, finances, relationships with Army families, or safety.

Studies show that a substantial minority of those serving develop persistent emotional sequelae (such as PTSD and other psychological health problems) and\/or somatic or cognitive sequelae (postconcussive symptoms) of traumatic exposure. Remarkably, the mechanism (emotional versus biomechanical) and locus (head versus other regions) of injury are weak determinants of whether an individual develops PTSD, persistent postconcussive symptoms, or both. Preexisting or traumatically acquired cognitive dysfunction can increase the risk for these syndromes, probably by reducing cognitive reserve. Structural and functional neuroimaging studies can be interpreted to explain part of the shared symptomatic and functional variance in these syndromes, but this literature is far from consistent and serves mainly to raise new, challenging questions about mutual pathophysiology. The frequent confluence of PTSD and persistent postconcussive symptoms in military personnel strains the bounds of these constructs. New studies are needed to improve our understanding of how emotional and biomechanical stressors can yield these adverse outcomes and how such outcomes can be prevented and treated.","url":"http:\/\/ajp.psychiatryonline.org\/article.aspx?articleid=100941","citationKey":"1157","doi":"10.1176\/appi.ajp.2009.08101604","authorAddress":"Stein, MB (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego 0855, Dept Psychiat, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USAUniv Calif San Diego 0855, Dept Psychiat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USAUniv Calif San Diego, Dept Family & Prevent Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USAVA San Diego Healthcare Syst, San Diego, CA USADartmouth Med Sch, Sect Neuropsychiat, Dept Psychiat, Lebanon, NH USA","authorList":["Stein, MB","McAllister, TW"],"keywords":["psychiatric disorders","mental disorders","combat","POSTCONCUSSIVE SYMPTOMS","COMORBIDITY SURVEY REPLICATION","IRAQ WAR","CLINICAL MANAGEMENT","US","cognitive ability","posttraumatic stress disorder","PTSD","mild traumatic brain injury","mild TBI","mTBI"],"id":"doi:10.1176\/appi.ajp.2009.08101604"},

While many of the mental health readjustment issues of female service members are likely to mirror those of the majority male Veteran population, this newest generation of women Veterans may also face unique threats to their mental health. The goal of this review it to highlight emerging issues relevant to the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among women deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan by reviewing the existing literature on gender-relevant issues among this cohort, as well as raising theoretically important issues that are worthy of further empirical investigation. Topics addressed include gender differences in combat experiences and in PTSD following combat exposure; sexual assault, sexual harassment and other interpersonal stressors experienced during deployment; women Veterans' experiences of premilitary trauma exposure; and unique stressors faced by women Veterans during the homecoming readjustment period. Given that most models of the impact of war zone deployment on PTSD are predicated on the experiences of male service members, women's expanding role in combat operations presents both an opportunity and a challenge to adapt these models to more effectively capture the experiences of female service members.

Belief in exposure to toxic agents, even when none is documented, is not uncommon in crisis and merits vigilant health care evaluation and services. This study examined risk factors (demographics, physical symptoms, clinical diagnosis, exposures, and health status) for belief in exposure to potential terrorist agents (nerve or mustard gas) using a large sample of Gulf War veterans who reported belief in exposure to nerve or mustard gas. We found that females, nonwhites, and those who were older (age 32 to 61 years) were more likely to report exposure. When adjusting for demographics and military service, these veterans reported more exposures (nonnerve or mustard gas) to potentially toxic agents and traumatic events (odds ratio [OR], 6.80; p < .001), reported more physical symptoms during the Gulf War (OR, 2.38; p < .001), were more likely to be diagnosed with a mental disorder (OR, 1.72; p < .001), and reported poorer current health status (OR, 3.47 to 1.22; p < .001). Not unlike previously reported studies of disasters, traumatic exposures, or risk exposures, belief in exposure to toxic agents suggests that certain people are at a greater health care risk. This knowledge will aid in better responding to rapid demands that may be placed on our health care delivery systems in times of potential terrorist activity.","url":"http:\/\/ovidsp.tx.ovid.com\/sp-3.5.1a\/ovidweb.cgi?QS2=434f4e1a73d37e8c54b7bccef7797d0cdc69f6b9e40049b25d48c2ecc36caafbb79cb919ff08e472cfd162917c49ddda5b6a748ac640a3ddedbf58f70880cc5136f9327d438a830a774243cb1ffa2dcfbb4241b6c9bdd306b93b03ebf8e4bd654b642024ed1","citationKey":"1166","doi":"N\/A","authorAddress":"Stuart, JA (reprint author), Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Psychiat, Ctr Study Traumat Stress, 4301 Jones Bridge Rd, Bethesda, MD 20814 USAUniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Psychiat, Ctr Study Traumat Stress, Bethesda, MD 20814 USALoyola Coll, Dept Pastoral Counseling, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA","authorList":["Stuart, JA","Ursano, R.

Design and method: A subsample of 470 sexually active male military personnel was drawn from a stratified systematic sample of military personnel stationed along the three largest border-crossing zones on the western border of the Dominican Republic. Using a verbally administered questionnaire, an examination of how foci of current HIV prevention programming with military personnel correlated with key sexual risk behavioral outcomes was conducted. Results: Mental health factors such as probable alcohol abuse and posttraumatic stress disorder showed consistent associations with sexual risk behaviors. Participants showed a relatively high level of HIV\/AIDS-related knowledge, a moderate level of negative attitudes toward condoms, and a moderate level of stigma toward people living with HIV\/AIDS. Psychosocial factors, which are typically preventive in nature, were not associated with decreased sexual risk behaviors. Conclusion: Gaps were identified in HIV prevention programming that need to be addressed in this population of sexually active male military personnel. Although knowledge, attitudes, and psychosocial factors are important foci of HIV prevention programming, they were not associated with sexual risk behaviors, particularly after controlling for mental health factors. The authors suggest that prevalent psychiatric disorders in military personnel, such as posttraumatic stress disorder, should be factored in to the development of HIV prevention programs for military personnel.","url":"http:\/\/jmh.sagepub.com\/content\/5\/1\/65.short","citationKey":"1177","doi":"10.1177\/1557988310362097","authorAddress":"Anastario, MP (reprint author), Cicatelli Associates Inc, 505 8th Ave,Suite 1600, New York, NY 10003 USAArmed Forces Dominican Republ, Santo Domingo, Dominican RepDept Def HIV AIDS Prevent Program, San Diego, CA USACicatelli Associates Inc, New York, NY 10003 USA","authorList":["Tavarez, MI","Chun, H","Anastario, MP"],"keywords":["POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER","DEPRESSION","MILITARY PERSONNEL","MENTAL-HEALTH","PRIMARY-CARE","UNITED-STATES","KNOWLEDGE","HIV","PHQ-9","sexual behavior","attitude","CONDOM USE","Dominican Republic","PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE","practices","TRANSMITTED-DISEASES"],"meshTerms":["Adult","Dominican Republic","Haiti","Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice","Health Surveys","Humans","Mental Health","Military Personnel","Prostitution","Unsafe Sex","Young Adult","United States Department of Veterans Affairs","Veterans","United States","Veterans","War","Time Factors","United States","United States Department of Veterans Affairs","War","Referral and Consultation","Role","Spouse Abuse","Veterans","Young Adult"],"id":"doi:10.1177\/1557988310362097"},

The current article draws on data from the 1996 National Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers and Clients in order to examine differences between currently homeless veterans and nonveterans in the number of months they had been homeless at the time they were interviewed. A social selection perspective formed the basis for hypotheses about factors affecting variation in length of current homelessness. The results indicate that current episodes of homelessness were longest among veterans of the all-volunteer force, those with behavioral risk factors with possible early onset, and those who were lacking in social bonds to civilian society that are normally conferred by employment, marriage, and support from family of origin. Although recent age cohorts of enlistees in the all-volunteer force do not show the same pattern of vulnerabilities, the Department of Defense needs to continue to pay close attention to the screening of military applicants for mental health and substance use problems, and to invest in programs that give psychosocial support to those veterans whose connections to civilian society are most tenuous.","url":"http:\/\/web.ebscohost.com\/ehost\/detail?vid=48&hid=112&sid=0c2184e9-1467-406d-9cbd-ba122b235e7d%40sessionmgr11&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&AN=11073008","citationKey":"1179","issn":"0095-327X","authorAddress":"Tessler, R (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Social & Demog Res Inst, W34A Machmer Hall,240 Hicks Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USAUniv Massachusetts, Social & Demog Res Inst, Amherst, MA 01003 USAUS Vet Adm, NE Program Evaluat Ctr, Northampton, MA USAYale Univ, Sch Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","authorList":["Tessler, R","Rosenheck, R","Gamache, G"],"keywords":["MILITARY SERVICE","VETERANS","MEN","homeless veterans","PROPORTION","HOMELESSNESS","Armed Forces","VOLUNTARY military service"],"id":"http:\/\/msrc.idiginfo.org\/documents\/8885\/pub"},

In the context of the Second World War, such adaptation meant accepting the duties of a soldier In the published writings regarding the first Northfield experiment, the psychiatrist Wilfred Bion emphasised his military role in returning patients to their units, a job which he thought was best conducted by men like himself who had experience of leading men into battle. Writing about the second experiment, Tom Main emphasised the importance of including military staff in every aspect of the hospital life from therapy to administration.

However, studies have shown varying prevalence rates of these disorders based on different case definitions and have not assessed functional impairment, alcohol misuse, or aggressive behavior as comorbid factors occurring with PTSD and depression.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\nTo (1) examine the prevalence rates of depression and PTSD using several case definitions including functional impairment, (2) determine the comorbidity of alcohol misuse or aggressive behaviors with depression or PTSD, and (3) compare rates between Active Component and National Guard soldiers at the 3- and 12-month time points following their deployment to Iraq.\r\n\r\nDESIGN:\r\nPopulation-based, cross-sectional study.\r\n\r\nSETTING:\r\nUnited States Army posts and National Guard armories.\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS:\r\nA total of 18 305 US Army soldiers from 4 Active Component and 2 National Guard infantry brigade combat teams.\r\n\r\nINTERVENTIONS:\r\nBetween 2004 and 2007, anonymous mental health surveys were collected at 3 and 12 months following deployment.\r\n\r\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:\r\nCurrent PTSD, depression, functional impairment, alcohol misuse, and aggressive behavior.\r\n\r\nRESULTS:\r\nPrevalence rates for PTSD or depression with serious functional impairment ranged between 8.5% and 14.0%, with some impairment between 23.2% and 31.1%. Alcohol misuse or aggressive behavior comorbidity was present in approximately half of the cases. Rates remained stable for the Active Component soldiers but increased across all case definitions from the 3- to 12-month time point for National Guard soldiers.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThe prevalence rates of PTSD and depression after returning from combat ranged from 9% to 31% depending on the level of functional impairment reported. The high comorbidity with alcohol misuse and aggression highlights the need for comprehensive postdeployment screening. Persistent or increased prevalence rates at 12 months compared with 3 months postdeployment illustrate the persistent effects of war zone service and provide important data to guide postdeployment care.","url":"http:\/\/archpsyc.ama-assn.org\/cgi\/content\/abstract\/67\/6\/614","citationKey":"1181","doi":"10.1001\/archgenpsychiatry.2010.54","authorAddress":"Thomas, JL (reprint author), USA, Med Res & Mat Command, Walter Reed Army Inst Res, Dept Mil Psychiat,Div Psychiat & Neurosci, 503 Robert Grant Ave, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USAUSA, Med Res & Mat Command, Walter Reed Army Inst Res, Dept Mil Psychiat,Div Psychiat & Neurosci, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USAUSA, Med Res & Mat Command, Walter Reed Army Inst Res, USA Med Res Unit Europe, Heidelberg, GermanyUSA, Med Res & Mat Command, Mil Operat Med Res Program, Ft Detrick, MD USA","authorList":["Thomas, J.

Stress can induce lasting changes in the negative feedback regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) and the regulation of the immune system by cortisol. Since these actions of cortisol are modulated via glucocorticoid receptors (GR), we investigated the effect of deployment and of deployment-related fatigue on glucocorticoid binding to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a prospective design. Psychological assessments and blood sample collection took place before and one and six months after deployment. Participants were selected from a larger group and assigned to three groups based on their level of fatigue and depressive symptoms six months after deployment. We compared fatigued participants without depressive symptoms (n = 21), fatigued participants with depressive symptoms (n = 14) and non-fatigued participants without depressive symptoms (n = 21). Fatigued participants with depressive symptoms at six months after deployment had higher glucocorticoid binding to PBMCs than the other two groups at all three time points. Notably, this difference was already present before deployment. There was no effect of deployment on glucocorticoid binding to PBMCs. The observed differences in glucocorticoid binding were not related to pre-existing group differences in psychological symptoms. No group differences were observed in the composition of the PBMC population and plasma cortisol levels. These results indicate that high glucocorticoid binding to PBMCs might represent a vulnerability factor for the development of severe fatigue with depressive symptoms after a sustained period of stress, such as deployment.

Neuropsychological performance deficits serve as sensitive measures of neural dysfunction and are often associated with psychosocial and occupational problems. Previous studies have not conducted objective neuropsychological assessments both before and after a major war-zone deployment.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE:\r\n\r\nTo examine objective neuropsychological outcomes of Iraq War deployment in a large military cohort.\r\n\r\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:\r\n\r\nThe Neurocognition Deployment Health Study, a prospective, cohort-controlled study conducted at military installations. This report centers on 961 male and female active-duty Army soldiers drawn from the larger cohort. Deploying Army soldiers (n = 654) were examined prior to deployment to Iraq (April-December 2003) and shortly after return (within a mean of 73 days [median, 75 days]; January-May 2005) from Iraq deployment. A comparison group of soldiers (n = 307) similar in military characteristics but not deploying overseas during the study was assessed in sessions timed to be as close as possible to the assessment of deployers. Military unit sampling procedures facilitated representation of combat, combat support, and combat service support functions among both deployers and nondeployers.\r\n\r\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:\r\n\r\nIndividually administered, performance-based neuropsychological tasks. Estimates (beta; the unstandardized parameter estimate) for the absolute differences in adjusted mean outcome scores between deployed and nondeployed groups were determined using generalized estimating equations.\r\n\r\nRESULTS:\r\n\r\nMultiple linear regression analyses adjusted for battalion membership revealed that Iraq deployment, compared with nondeployment, was associated with neuropsychological compromise on tasks of sustained attention (beta = 0.11; P<.001), verbal learning (beta = -1.51; P = .003), and visual-spatial memory (beta = -3.82; P<.001). Iraq deployment was also associated with increased negative state affect on measures of confusion (beta = 1.40; P<.001) and tension (beta = 1.24; P<.001). In contrast, deployment was associated with improved simple reaction time (beta = 4.30; P = .003). Deployment effects remained statistically significant after taking into account deployment-related head injury and stress and depression symptoms.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n\r\nDeployment to Iraq is associated with increased risk of neuropsychological compromise. Findings point to the need to investigate further the impact of deployment on neural functioning. Public health implications include consideration of neuropsychological compromise in health prevention and postdeployment clinical and occupational management.","url":"http:\/\/jama.ama-assn.org\/content\/296\/5\/519.long","citationKey":"1192","doi":"10.1001\/jama.296.5.519","authorAddress":"Vasterling, JJ (reprint author), SE Louisiana Vet Hlth Care Syst, Res Serv COSF, 1601 Perdido St, New Orleans, LA 70112 USASE Louisiana Vet Hlth Care Syst, Res Serv COSF, New Orleans, LA 70112 USATulane Univ, Sch Med, New Orleans, LA 70112 USAVA Boston Healthcare Syst, Boston, MA USABoston Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA USAUSA, Environm Med Res Inst, Natick, MA 01760 USAMadigan Army Med Ctr, Ft Lewis, WA USAVA Maryland Hlth Care Syst, Baltimore, MD USAUniv Maryland, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA","authorList":["Vasterling, JJ","Proctor, SP","Amoroso, P.","Kane, R.","Heeren, T.","White, R.

The analyses of the data are guided by the comprehensive model of work-family conflict that has been tested by Frone, Russell, and Cooper (1992) using a large representative community sample. Structural equation modeling analyses provided support for the work-family conflict model. The analyses also provided support for an extension of the model, which included the separate effects of marital and parental roles on mental health. The extended model demonstrated that job and parental stresses had direct effects on work-family conflicts and that job and marital distress and family-work conflict had an independent adverse effect on mental health. Whereas job and parental involvement had a beneficial effect on distress, they had an adverse effect on work-family conflicts.

The authors examined the HRQL of military personnel deployed to the Gulf War Theater compared with those not deployed. In 1995-1996, a structured, population-based telephone survey was conducted 5 years postconflict among a cohort originally from Iowa on active duty during the conflict. The sample included 4,886 eligible subjects stratified by deployment and military status and proportionately distributed within five substrata, The Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) assessed HRQL, and multivariable linear regression identified pre- and perideployment risk factors. A total of 3,695 respondents (76%) participated. Nondeployed participants reported excellent health more often than deployed participants (31% vs. 21%, p < 0.01). SF-36 scores for deployed participants were poorer than those for nondeployed controls across all health domains. Modifiable factors such as smoking and military preparedness, and other factors such as predeployment physical and mental health morbidity, were independent risk factors for poorer HRQL after deployment. Deployed veterans reported slightly poorer HRQL even after the authors adjusted for other risk factors. Further investigation of factors influencing postdeployment HRQL is needed. Routine collection of health information by using standardized instruments pre- and perideployment should be implemented.","url":"http:\/\/aje.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/155\/10\/899.short","citationKey":"1198","authorAddress":"Doebbeling, BN (reprint author), Univ Iowa, Dept Internal Med, Coll Med, SE 625 GH, Iowa City, IA 52242 USAUniv Iowa, Dept Internal Med, Coll Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USAUniv Alabama, Dept Med, Birmingham, AL 35294 USADuke Univ, Med Ctr, Durham, NC USAUniv Iowa, Dept Epidemiol, Coll Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USAUniv Iowa, Dept Biostat, Coll Publ Hlth, Iowa City, IA 52242 USAVet Affairs Med Ctr, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","authorList":["Voelker, MD","Saag, KG","Schwartz, DA","Chrischilles, E","Clarke, WR","Woolson, RF","Doebbeling, BN"],"keywords":["US VETERANS","MILITARY PERSONNEL","MORTALITY","PERSIAN-GULF","IMPACT","SERVICES","quality of life","risk factors","OPERATION-DESERT-STORM","MEDICAL OUTCOMES","Persian Gulf syndrome","SURVEY SF-36","OF-LIFE","FRAMEWORK","health status","Health Surveys","models, statistical"],"id":"http:\/\/msrc.idiginfo.org\/documents\/8903\/pub"},

Thus it is critical to identify factors that interfere with the use of mental health services for this population, and where possible, intervene to reduce barriers to care. The overarching goal of this review was to examine what is known with regard to concerns about public stigma and personal beliefs about mental illness and mental health treatment as potential barriers to service use in military and veteran populations and to provide recommendations for future research on this topic.\r\n\r\nMethods: Fifteen empirical articles on mental health beliefs and service use were identified via a review of the military and veteran literature included in PsycINFO and PubMed databases.\r\n\r\nResults: Although results suggest that mental health beliefs may be an important predictor of service use for this population, several gaps were identified in the current literature. Limitations include a lack of attention to the association between mental health beliefs and service use, a limited focus on personal beliefs about mental illness and mental health treatment, and the application of measures of mental health beliefs with questionable or undocumented psychometric properties.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Studies that attend to these important issues and that examine mental health beliefs in the broader context within which decisions about seeking health care are made can be used to best target resources to engage military personnel and veterans in health care.

In Study 1, we documented reasonably high levels of satisfaction and attainment among Vietnam veterans, levels that differed minimally, on average, from those who served elsewhere and those who never served in the military. In Study 2, dimensions of war-zone stressor exposure were only marginally related to satisfaction and attainment, in contrast with research documenting strong relationships with psychopathology. These findings support the importance of expanding our thinking about dimensions of mental illness and mental health.","url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1559-1816.2004.tb02586.x\/abstract","citationKey":"1200","doi":"10.1111\/j.1559-1816.2004.tb02586.x","authorAddress":"Vogt, DS (reprint author), VA Boston Healthcare Syst, Natl Ctr Posttraumat Stress Disorder, 116B-5,150 S Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02130 USAVA Boston Healthcare Syst, Natl Ctr Posttraumat Stress Disorder, Boston, MA 02130 USABoston Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA","authorList":["Vogt, DS","King, DW","King, LA","Savarese, VW","Suvak, MK"],"keywords":["POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER","MILITARY SERVICE","PREVALENCE","HEALTH","PSYCHOLOGY","FEMALE","traumatic events","EXPERIENCE","NATIONAL SAMPLE","MISSISSIPPI SCALE"],"id":"doi:10.1111\/j.1559-1816.2004.tb02586.x"},

Although initial evidence for the reliability and validity of DRRI scales based on Gulf War veteran samples is encouraging, evidence with respect to a more contemporary cohort of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) veterans is not available. Therefore, the primary goal of the present study was to validate scales from the DRRI in a large sample of OIF army personnel diversified in occupational and demographic characteristics. In general, results supported the use of these DRRI scales in this population. Internal consistency reliability estimates were quite strong. Additionally, support was obtained for criterion-related validity, as demonstrated by associations with mental and physical health measures, and discriminative validity, as demonstrated by differences between key military subgroups.","url":"http:\/\/asm.sagepub.com\/content\/15\/4\/391.long","citationKey":"1203","doi":"10.1177\/1073191108316030","authorAddress":"Vogt, DS (reprint author), VA Boston Healthcare Syst 116B5, Womens Hlth Sci Div, 150 S Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02130 USABoston Univ, Natl Ctr PTSD, Womens Hlth Sci Div, VA Boston Healthcare Syst,Dept Psychiat,Sch Med, Boston, MA 02215 USABoston Univ, Natl Ctr PTSD, Womens Hlth Sci Div, VA Boston Healthcare Syst,Dept Psychol, Boston, MA 02215 USABoston Univ, Natl Ctr PTSD, VA Boston Healthcare Syst, Behav Sci Div,Dept Psychol, Boston, MA 02215 USABoston Univ, Natl Ctr PTSD, VA Boston Healthcare Syst, Behav Sci Div,Dept Psychiat,Sch Med,Psychol Serv, Boston, MA 02215 USABoston Univ, VA Boston Healthcare Syst, Dept Environm Hlth,Sch Publ Hlth,Res Serv, USA,Res Inst Environm Med,Mil Performance Div, Boston, MA 02215 USA","authorList":["Vogt, DS","Proctor, SP","King, DW","King, LA","Vasterling, JJ"],"keywords":["Instrument Validation","Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory","OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM","OIF","VETERANS","cognition","DEPRESSION","IRAQ","MILITARY PERSONNEL","military psychiatry","Neuropsychological Tests","psychological tests","Psychometrics","Reproducibility of Results","risk factors","DRRI","Gulf War veterans","CONSISTENCY","Validity"],"meshTerms":["Adult","Cognition","Depression","Health Status","Health Status Indicators","Humans","Iraq","Iraq War, 2003 -","Middle Aged","Military Personnel","Military Psychiatry","Neuropsychological Tests","Psychological Tests","Psychometrics","Reproducibility of Results","Risk Factors","Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","United States","Veterans","War","Referral and Consultation","Role","Spouse Abuse","Young Adult"],"id":"doi:10.1177\/1073191108316030"},
